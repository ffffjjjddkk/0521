          <p>What is FOMO? It quite literally means being scared of missing out on something. Those with FOMO might have the feeling that others are living better lives or having more fun than they are. They might have low self-esteem. They feel like, in conclusion, they’re not experiencing something that others are at the moment. <br>
            FOMO can apply to many scenarios, from not attending a party to missing out on a club event. The common factor here is that those with FOMO feel helpless that they're missing out on something big in life. </p>

          <div class="bc1 wow bounceIn">
            <p> The phenomenon ”FOMO'' was first identified in 1996 by marketing strategist, Dr. Dan Herman, who conducted research for Adam Bellouch and published the first academic paper on the topic in 2000 in The Journal of Brand Management. </p>
          </div>
          <div class="bc2 wow bounceIn " data-wow-delay="0.5s">
            <p>Further research was popularized in a 2004 edition of a Harvard Business School’s student paper, The Harbus, by a student named Patrick McGinnis, who coined the term FOMO. In his article, McGinnis describes two opposing but intertwined forces: FOMO and FOBO,which means fear of a better option, and their role in social life. When people are afraid of missing opportunities while simultaneously being afraid of commitment, the result is social catatonia.</p>

            <p> A decade later, Ben Schreckinger theorizes these acronyms were birthed from the circumstances of the late 1990s/early 2000s . But the word didn’t enter the common vernacular until the 2010s, when the feeling was growing among young people due to social media and internet use. </p>

        <p> Social media apps such as Instagram and TikTok are undoubtedly one of the main reasons teens have such low self-esteem issues nowadays. However, according to verywellmind, Fomo actually increases the use of social media, creating this never-ending loop of negativity. 
          Depression and anxiety are also factors that trigger even more social media use, and thus increase FOMO-induced stress. </p>
        <h4 class="wow pulse">Computers in Human Behavior</h4>
        <p>The results of this study showed that FOMO was present for participants throughout the day, but mostly later in the day and near the end of the week (TGIF, am I right?!).
          People whose behaviors felt more like personal obligations, including studying or working, were more likely to report greater FOMO. It was also associated with the predicted negative outcomes, such as fatigue, stress, sleep problems, and psychosomatic symptoms. Curiously enough, when it came to the personal findings, FOMO was not predicted by neuroticism or extraversion. It’s felt by all regardless of temperament.
          Furthermore,FOMO poses a  potential risk to our lives.
          Published in Computers and Human Behavior.First, it related to a lower sense of having one's needs as well as a lower feeling of life satisfaction in general. As other studies have suggested, it appears that FOMO is linked to both feeling a need to engage in social media and increasing engagement. In summary,FOMO and social media habits may contribute to another negative, self-perpetuating cycle.
          What's more,aside from increasing unhappiness, fear of missing out also leads to greater involvement in unhealthy behaviors. For example, the study in Computers and Human Behavior found that FOMO was associated with  distracted driving, which in some cases may  cause death. </p>

        <h3 id="a3">Common question on FOMO</h3>
        <div class="a">
          <h4>Does FOMO only occur in teenagers? </h4>
        </div>
        <div class="a1 wow flipInX" data-wow-delay="1s" >
          <p>Well, FOMO can be experienced by people of all ages.One study in the Psychiatry Research journal found that it was linked to  greater smartphone and social media usage and wasn’t associated with age or gender.
            Also,both social media and smartphone use are related to fears of negative and even positive evaluations by others ,as well as connected with negative effects on mood.<br>
            Like a recent study published in Motivation and Emotion, scientists at Carleton and McGill University examined the social-psychological basis of FOMO. They wanted to see how it affected first-year university students, predicting it would be associated with a host of negative outcomes related to stress and negative emotionality. Further, the scientists predicted that students who experienced FOMO would be more likely to miss out on sleep and experience more fatigue. </p>

          <h4>How the researchers did the experiment </h4>
        </div>
        <div class="a1 wow flipInX"  data-wow-delay="1s">
          <p>First-year university students with smartphones completed a diary for 7 days. They received five alerts throughout the day with a link to a survey which asked them about their present experiences. At the end of the semester, the students were asked to complete an online questionnaire that focused on well-being and life satisfaction. </p>

      <div class="a1">
        <p>If you are being bothered by FOMO, don't worry, let’s take a look at some steps that can curb your present situation. 
          First, “Change Your Focus” means trying to notice what you have rather than focusing on what you don't. We’re bombarded with images, information, and messages every day, so we should hide someone who flaunts themselves and add more people who are positive to our feed.
          Second, “Keep a Journal”. We usually post on social media to record our life in pieces. However, we may care much about whether people validate these posts as a result. So keep a diary offline either on paper or journal apps instead.
          Third, “Seek Out Real Connections”. Whether arranging a meeting with a friend or creating a group outing, meeting up with people in person is a fabulous change of pace and it can help shake the feeling that you are missing out.
          Everyone feels a certain level of FOMO at different times. As long as we face it head-on, reach out to friends, and spend some time reflecting on things we are appreciative of in life, we can definitely put a curb on it. Let’s pay more attention to the real world! </p>
